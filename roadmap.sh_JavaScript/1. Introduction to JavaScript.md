## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It allows developers to create interactive features, such as dynamic content updates, interactive maps, and 2D/3D graphics. As of 2025, approximately **98.9% of all websites** use JavaScript on the client side for page behavior. 

- **Key Characteristics:** It is interpreted (runs directly in a browser or runtime without a separate compilation step), dynamically typed, and supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 

## History of JavaScript

- **Creation (1995):** Invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in just 10 days in May 1995.
- **Naming Evolution:** Originally named **Mocha**, then briefly **LiveScript**, it was finally named **JavaScript** in December 1995 to capitalize on the popularity of the Java language.
- **Standardization (1997):** To prevent fragmentation caused by competing versions (like Microsoft’s JScript), the language was submitted to ECMA International for standardization. This led to the official name **ECMAScript**.
- **Expansion:** The release of Google’s V8 engine (2008) and Node.js (2009) allowed JavaScript to run outside the browser, enabling server-side and full-stack development. 

## JavaScript Versions (ECMAScript)

Since 2015, JavaScript versions have been released annually and named by the year of publication. 

|Version|Year|Key Features|
|---|---|---|
|**ES1 – ES3**|1997–1999|Standardized the language; added regex and try/catch.|
|**ES5**|2009|Added "strict mode," JSON support, and advanced array methods.|
|**ES6 (ES2015)**|2015|A landmark update: introduced classes, modules, arrow functions, and promises.|
|**ES2016 – ES2024**|Annual|Incremental updates adding features like `async/await`, optional chaining, and `Object.groupBy`.|
|**ES2025**|**2025**|Latest version featuring a built-in **Iterator** object, new **Set** methods (intersection, difference), and `Promise.try`.|

## How to Run JavaScript

You can execute JavaScript in various environments depending on your needs:

1. **In a Web Browser:**
    - **HTML Embedding:** Use the `<script>` tag within an HTML file to include code directly or link to an external `.js` file.
    - **Developer Console:** Open any browser (F12 or right-click > Inspect), navigate to the "Console" tab, and type code directly for instant execution.
2. **On a Server (Local Machine):**
    - **Runtime Environments:** Install runtimes like **Node.js**, **Deno**, or **Bun**.
    - **Execution:** Create a file (e.g., `app.js`) and run it via the terminal using a command like `node app.js`.
3. **Online Sandboxes:**
    - Use platforms like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/gist/library/pure/3775927/), or [RunJS](https://runjs.app/play) to write and test code without any local setup.
