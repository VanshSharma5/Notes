In JavaScript, data types are broadly categorized into two groups: ==**Primitive** and **Non-Primitive** (also known as Reference or Object) types==. As of 2025, JavaScript officially recognizes **eight** fundamental data types.
## Primitive Types
In JavaScript, data types are categorized into ==**Primitive** and **Non-Primitive (Reference)** types==. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables are not bound to a specific data type and can change their type during execution.
