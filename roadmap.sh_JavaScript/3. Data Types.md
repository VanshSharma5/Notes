In JavaScript, data types are broadly categorized into two groups: ==**Primitive** and **Non-Primitive** (also known as Reference or Object) types==. As of 2025, JavaScript officially recognizes **eight**fundamental data types.
> There is not any specific number for the datatypes.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables are not bound to a specific data type and can change their type during execution.

## Primitive Data Types

| Number    | A number representing a mathematical value    |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Bigint    | A number representing a large integer         |
| String    | A text of characters enclosed in quotes       |
| Boolean   | A data type representing true or false        |
| Undefined | A primitive variable with no assigned value   |
| Null      | A primitive value representing object absence |
| Symbol    | A unique and primitive identifier             |
| Object    | A collection of key-value pairs of data       |
> Since JavaScript supports dynamic typing it means the same variable can hold different data types.

## Objects
In, JavaScript objects datatype is introduced to deal with complex data structures extending the data types beyond primitives 
1. Objects are written with curly braces i.e. in between { }.
2. Objects contains collection of primitives or Objects with their own *properties*(dynamic) and *attributes*(static).
3. Object properties are written as: `name:value` pairs, separated with commas.\
#### Some built-in Objects are:

| **Object** | The fundamental building block for complex data                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Array**  | Object of values accessed by a numerical index                   |
| **Date**   | Object for working with dates and times                          |
| **RegExp** | Object for working with regular expressions                      |
| **Map**    | Object of key-value pairs where the keys can be of any data type |
| **Set**    | Object of values where each value can only appear once           |
| **Error**  | Object represents error conditions during program execution      |

## typeof Operator
typeof operator in JavaScript use to determine the data type of a variable, literal or an expression.
**Syntax:** `typeof <variablename>`
